## Project Description
This mini-project is a little fun game that allows a user to guess a number in 10 turns or less. The game will let the user know if they got the number correct, in which case they can start a new game. If the guesses are wrong by the 10th turn, the game ends and the user gets to see what the correct answer was. At this point, they can also start another game.

## Project Status
This project's functionality is complete but I could edit it as I grasp the concepts better.

## Project Context
This mini-project is my way os crystallising my understanding of Javascript concepts and practising as I go along in my self-taught journey. Pushing to Git, writing this README and sharing on Twitter pis helping to improve my skills.

## Technologies
This mini-project uses HTML and Javascript

## Roadmap
Create more mini projects like this one to keep myself going.
